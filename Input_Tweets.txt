Trump Tweets: 
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/xV1lgfhjBU NEWTWEET My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD. https://t.co/AoingY77Ky NEWTWEET Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican! NEWTWEET ....agencies, not just the FBI &amp; DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don‚Äôt believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).‚Äù Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews NEWTWEET ‚ÄúMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he‚Äôs been victimized. He‚Äôs been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of....... NEWTWEET Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? NEWTWEET According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP! NEWTWEET The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form! NEWTWEET Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low! NEWTWEET Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now! NEWTWEET Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election! NEWTWEET Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything ‚Äî and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! NEWTWEET Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a ‚Äúpaper trail‚Äù on a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary. NEWTWEET Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/yukxm48x9X NEWTWEET As long as we open our eyes to God‚Äôs grace - and open our hearts to God‚Äôs love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast https://t.co/1cwxs3l0uK NEWTWEET I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea, China and the Middle East. NEWTWEET Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence.

Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there. Looking forward to seeing all! NEWTWEET The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great.

Watch here: https://t.co/VPMTnko7Ik https://t.co/4OaXXuj9Va NEWTWEET We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system.  Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. https://t.co/rP9Gtr2E5N NEWTWEET Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration &amp; cancels the visa lottery. If D‚Äôs oppose this deal, they aren‚Äôt serious about DACA-they just want open borders. https://t.co/XDMcDOr9vM NEWTWEET My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts NEWTWEET So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! NEWTWEET Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS! https://t.co/GISFbDDGXX NEWTWEET Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure! NEWTWEET Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! NEWTWEET Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! NEWTWEET Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that‚Äôs why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition! NEWTWEET The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks! NEWTWEET Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory! NEWTWEET My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they‚Äôve done! NEWTWEET ...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn‚Äôt straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.‚Äù Wall Street Journal NEWTWEET ‚ÄúThe four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became.... NEWTWEET Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion! NEWTWEET This memo totally vindicates ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace! NEWTWEET Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain ‚Äúsacred cows.‚Äù Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well, someday!

Rank &amp; File are great people! NEWTWEET The Democrats just aren‚Äôt calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they‚Äôll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast. NEWTWEET Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart! NEWTWEET March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW! NEWTWEET Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in ‚Äò18.

NEWTWEET Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED! NEWTWEET Democrats are not interested in Border Safety &amp; Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction! NEWTWEET I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it! NEWTWEET Taliban targeted innocent Afghans, brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win! NEWTWEET On Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men, women and children, and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide.

Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!

They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election! NEWTWEET I don‚Äôt believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad! NEWTWEET AMERICA FIRST! NEWTWEET The Democrats are all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA. Great opportunity missed. Too bad! NEWTWEET Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!

Never said ‚Äútake them out.‚Äù Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust! NEWTWEET Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST! NEWTWEET The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! NEWTWEET ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten ‚Äúshutdown,‚Äù but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! NEWTWEET ....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund.... NEWTWEET The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain &amp; Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... NEWTWEET Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for ‚Äúpeanuts,‚Äù only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! NEWTWEET The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery &amp; Chain. USA! NEWTWEET Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first! NEWTWEET Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler, a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!

Together, we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/ptXa1hAPwW https://t.co/yv6RALkQf3 NEWTWEET The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, &amp; yet on and on it goes. Russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control! NEWTWEET The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary! NEWTWEET It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.

Call your House and Senate members at 202-224-3121 and tell them to take care of kids now and protect our seniors, the poor &amp; vulnerable from future attacks. Tell them that it‚Äôs the very least they can do. NEWTWEET How is it that in the middle of dividing up $1.5 trillion dollars between corporations &amp; the ultra-wealthy, Republicans can‚Äôt find the time &amp; money to take care of children? These are perverse priorities. Congress needs to pass CHIP now, as they have every year since the 1990s. NEWTWEET It gets worse. During the campaign I warned that the Rs would come after social security, Medicare, &amp; Medicaid &amp; now they are. Imagine buying a Rolex &amp; paying for it with money you saved to take care of your kids. That‚Äôs what Congress is doing w/ your tax dollars. NEWTWEET Meanwhile, Senate Republicans rushed to pass so-called tax reform - a giveaway for those who least need it. NEWTWEET The Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides health care for 9 million kids &amp; has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis every year for almost 2 decades, is hanging in limbo because Congress let it expire over 2 months ago.
